* Algorithm for segregating even and odd numbers in array*
--> Input the size of the array.
--> Input the elements of the array.
--> Initialize two separate arrays:
--> One to store even numbers.
--> One to store odd numbers.
--> Loop through the array:
--> If the number is even, add it to the even array.
--> If the number is odd, add it to the odd array.
--> Print the even array first.

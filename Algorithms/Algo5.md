* Algorithm for Finding the Second Largest Element in an Array *
--> Initialize the array.
--> Input number of elements and their values.
--> Initialize largest with the first element and secondLargest to -1.
--> Loop through the array from the second element:
--> If the current element is greater than largest:
--> Update secondLargest to largest.
--> Update largest to the current element.
--> Else if the current element is greater than secondLargest and not equal to largest:
--> Update secondLargest to the current element.
--> If secondLargest is not -1, print it; otherwise, indicate that no second largest exists.

* Algorithm for finding maximum and minimum element in array * 
--> Input the number of elements (n).
--> Input the array elements.
--> Initialize max and min with the first element of the array.
--> Loop through the array from the second element:
--> If the current element is greater than max, update max.
--> If the current element is less than min, update min.
--> Output the values of max and min.

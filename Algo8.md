* Algorithm for TwoSum Problem *
--> Input the size of the array and the target sum.
--> Input the elements of the array.
--> Loop through the array with index i:
--> For each element, loop again with index j (starting from i+1):
--> If the sum of nums[i] and nums[j] equals the target, print their indices.
--> If no pair is found after the loops, output that no such pair exists.
